# Embedded Systems Project on Home Automation

This project demonstrates automatic Temperature and Humidity regulation.

The set temperature is 32 degrees. If Our DHT22 reads a temperature below 32,
the heat coil is activated and its fan.

The fan is responsible for blowing the heated air around the room ensuring
max distribution of heat around the room.

if the temperature exceeds a certain threshhold e.g 40 degrees the heat coil and its fan is stopped.
if the temperature is too much, the cooling fans are activated and temperature is brought down.

The following is a picture of the prototype:
